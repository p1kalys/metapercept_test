# Excercise 1 : one page website

We need you to create a one-page website using [html](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/), [css](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/), [javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Language_Resources), [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/).

You have to use [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en) Chrome App to avoid [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) Error.

## How we want it to work

- We need to be able to create the one-page as per [wireframe](wireframe/page-design.png)
- Once you are able to create design as per wireframe then after in classe section you have to read data from the JSON file and display it in the classes section.

## Wireframe

In the [wireframe](wireframe) directory, you can find the wireframe.

## APIs

In the [data](data/) directory, you can find source files for class data.
You can assume these are in the format of the real external API.
For now, you can use this dummy data, but make sure we can plug in the real api in easily.

To create the class, just log it on the console, but make sure we can plug in the real api endpoint easily.

_NOTE: In this coding exercises you have to read data using JSON file not using an array variable._

## Excercise Related files

In the [related files](relatedfiles/) directory, you can find all related files.
